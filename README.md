# Python Workshop

### Introduction
This workshop is intended for statistics students who intend to learn 'data science using Python.' 
Often, statistics students have the basic theoretical knowledge of classification, regression and related machine learning tools but lack application using Python, which is often useful in many practical scenarios. 
We aim to bridge this gap with some real-world examples.

### Schedule
We want to cover 
 - Basic data manipulation using pandas
 - Basic linear algebra using Numpy
 - Application of more classical ML algorithms to a dataset using Scikit library.
 - Deep Learning methods with CNN, pre-trained model etc. (using PyTorch or Keras)
 - Calling Python function using R (not covered in the original workshop)
 - Using virtual environment (using the virtual environment in pronto/HPC is to be added).
