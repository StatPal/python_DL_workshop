# Python Workshop

### Introduction
This workshop is intended for statistics students who intend to learn 'data science using python'. 
Often, statistics students have the basic theoretical knowledge of the classification, regression and related machine learning tools, but lack application using python, often useful in many practical scenario. 
We aim to bridge this gap. 

### Schedule
We want to cover 
 - Basic data manipulation using pandas
 - Basic linear alegbra using numpy
 - Application of ML algorithms to a dataset using scikit
 - Deep Learning methods with CNN, pretrained model etc (using pytorch or keras)
 - Calling python function using R
 - Using virtual environment in pronto (with GPU).
